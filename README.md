## AtomizeCRM

**After my second surgery**, I decided to spend some time making a code projects so that i could have time thinking about DashDonate.

That project was creating (pretty much) a copy of Intercom - though it was a lot cheaper than other customers 😂

When my results were “**cancer free!**” (though my cancer started again in a few weeks likely) - I decided to close this project and start a standard business.

One of my great friends was my business partner, and just before my November MRI result, we were starting a great website business!

I kept my brain working during the new chemo types, though this stuff made my brain mush 😅

During the chemo cycles, I tried doing some code (a new re-launch of AtomizeCRM).

All of the code that I did (last year and this year) is now on this Repository.

—

Just to let you know some of the code might be good (most of it), though some may be bad 😅

Just have fun!

(Feel free to send an email about the code before I pass - hello@ryancastle.co.uk)

Any funding will be used to keep my website up and running so that others can be inspired by my legacy, stories, and the blog.
